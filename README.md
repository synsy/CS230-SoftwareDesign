# Draw It or Lose It - Software Design

## ðŸ§© Overview
**Client:** *The Gaming Room*  
The Gaming Room requested a **web-based** version of their game, *Draw It or Lose It*, to support multiple platforms.  
The game features team-based real-time guessing, requiring:
- Unique game, team, and player instances
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Real-time multiplayer support
- Strong focus on security and scalability

---

## ðŸŒŸ Key Strengths
- Clear translation of user requirements into technical designs
- Effective domain model showing **OOP principles**:
  - Encapsulation
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism
- Strong documentation of constraints like real-time communication and uniqueness enforcement

---

## ðŸ“š Lessons Learned
- Creating a detailed design document **before coding** greatly structured the project.
- In the future, I would also include a **system architecture diagram** for better visualization of server-client communication.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Interpreting User Needs
- Focused on **responsiveness**, **fair gameplay**, and **cross-device support**.
- Meeting user needs is critical for **usability, player satisfaction**, and overall **application success**.

---

## ðŸš€ Future Strategy
For similar projects, I would:
- Continue starting with **requirement gathering** and **domain modeling**
- Include **system diagrams** earlier in the process
- Use **iterative design and prototyping** to refine software architecture
